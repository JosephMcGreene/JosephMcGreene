### Hi there 👋 My name's Joseph (he/him), full stack dev on the TypeScript and Next.js train, but snakes 🐍 and coffee ☕ are cool too. Hit me up and let's build something together!

#### I'm currently working on a conference meeting application that should be up and running soon. If you have ideas for how to make it better, don't hesitate to reach out!

#### Ask me about: sustainability, ethical technology, video games
